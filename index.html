    <p>My name is Ashwin (pronounced USH-win) Rodrigues. I'm a writer. 
<br><br><br>
    These are some of my favorite stories I wrote while working as a business reporter at <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/contributor/Ashwin">Morning Brew</a> in 2022. 
<br><br><br>
I spoke with some of <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/06/23/meet-crypto-s-biggest-skeptics">the biggest crypto critics</a>. Not sure what's happened in the space since. 
<br><br>
I profiled <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/08/18/the-humble-empire-of-knees-over-toes-guy">Knees Over Toes Guy</a>.
      <br><br>
I looked into why you kept hearing about <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/10/06/why-does-every-fitness-influencer-suddenly-hate-seed-oils">seed oils</a>.
